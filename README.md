# Text Editor Made With SFML

i built this text editor using sfml and c++.
it has some functions like(currently)
- basic cursor movement(left, right, up, down)
- line break(when you press enter)
- backspace
- delete
- undo
- visible line number(will maybe make them relative).
  
and more MIGHT be added, idk.

I might post the building process on youtube, so you can also check that out.
