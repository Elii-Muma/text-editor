calm lil 2 percent, its reallly tough tho
cos like even last time--it would just go up from like 30-31% when i had a full screen of text
so im pretty sure this will not be that much different from it

talkin up the walls
good thing they talk right back to me
oh if i could go and tear them down
id have some place to sleep

and if that voice starts, getting angry
i go ahead and roll my sleeves

i cant ruuuuunnnn from myself 
but we can take this to the street

when yoouurree 'roouuunndd 'rooo-ahhh-aah-ahh-ahh-ouundd
and i resort to violence, one on one against my head
we'll go baacckk and forth for hours just like willows in the wind!
pour us - two drinks of ah-bi-ta
make up with my will
let you walk me back to that feeling
that we know too damn well

oh when youuureee.....

Go send me with the breeze
