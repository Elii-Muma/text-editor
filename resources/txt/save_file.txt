u guess for now there is no problemo, we can keep it like this


eventually, for performance...id have to reduce the undo stack size
to a smaller size. 

what if i wanted to add wrapping??
that would mean i want a single line to occupy...basically more than
one line, or to be displayed on more than one line

ill have to write documentation on how everything works so that i can 
just go back to it and read when i want to check out how it works

but so far i think my editor looks really cool.

what if i want to enable relative line numbers?? wouldnt that be cool

ill even make it have a compiler

some games, like for typing speed...it'll be so cool

wait whot?

i know right!?!

but first i think i have to finish implementing the cursor actions
and now ill add side scrolling...like now, shouldnt be too hard

when moving left, log the column of the cursor. then when you move down
check if the line is longer than the cursor column thing, if is, put
the cursor at the logged column index
if its shorter than the logged column index then put the cursor at 
the end of the line
