WHEN MOVING:
the position of the borders always needs to be at the bottom or otherwise maybe put on a different upper layer or something. will always need to be at the bottom
-> so we've created two views, one for the fixed UI the other for the scrollable UI
-> ill need to make the abstraction better -- improve the architecture --
-> layers are[bottom to top] :: main window(blue part) -> side border -> bottom border

CAMERA:
-> ill turn this "view" into a camera that can be controlled by the editor module
-> since it looks like the "editor" is becoming the main "controller"(i might need to make this change) 
-> so the camera will be what? views i can control(move_view_up, move_view_down, move_view_left, move_view_right)

problem:
-> the cursor position is always increasing...should it??
-> we draw the line number and the text at a certain position yes? or is it relative to its line number?
