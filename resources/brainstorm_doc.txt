WHEN MOVING:
the position of the borders always needs to be at the bottom or otherwise maybe put on a different upper layer or something. will always need to be at the bottom
-> so we've created two views, one for the fixed UI the other for the scrollable UI
-> ill need to make the abstraction better -- improve the architecture --
-> layers are[bottom to top] :: main window(blue part) -> side border -> bottom border

CAMERA:
-> ill turn this "view" into a camera that can be controlled by the editor module
-> since it looks like the "editor" is becoming the main "controller"(i might need to make this change) 
-> so the camera will be what? views i can control(move_view_up, move_view_down, move_view_left, move_view_right)

problem:
-> the cursor position is always increasing...should it??
-> we draw the line number and the text at a certain position yes? or is it relative to its line number?
-> i did zome math to move the camera and zhit

okay now i think i need to rethink the architecture of the system:
-> right now the editor handles EVERYTHING
-> but i need something to handle: writing onto a "board", and the "text" will have its own settings...
->okay so we need the "board" and the "text". text comes in as input, and then based on the board selected, the text will be written there...
->e.g we have the bottome board and the center/main panel...the cursor is what we can use for focus. 
--> the text on the main panel/board/...whatever always renders, the text on the bottom panel only renders when in focus
--> in editor: handlInput() is what handles all user input an what each character pressed does...
--> i think they have different types of cursors...each cursor can have "is" focused
--> the current "editor" is just a module that handles the text: where to place it, how to place it, what to do with -- basically just a giant textHandler, and then i could have the "Editor" be a board where text can be placed...

--> contentHandler(will have text handling and cursor movement and stuff), Views(Editor View, BottomBorderView), Controller(like the Game Class)
